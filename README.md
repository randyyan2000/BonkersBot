My first attempt at making discord bot

To be used personally (and maybe by a few friends) to track new scores for osu

Planning to use Ameo's [osu!track](https://github.com/Ameobea/osutrack-api) api for updates and potentially osu v1 API for getting beatmapset_id for thumbnails, titles, diff names for more descriptive embeds.
